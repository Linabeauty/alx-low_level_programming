			FILE I/O IN C PROGRAMMING


In this project, i learnt about file descriptor and their POSIX names also the difference between their functions and system calls.


I also practiced with the I/O system calls open, close, read, and write and the flags O_RDONLY, WR_ONLY, and O_RDWR to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in c.


I created an header file for this project where all protypes used in the project are arranged in a file and help in the dubugging of my codes.


The tasks done on this project are done using the file i/o functions.
