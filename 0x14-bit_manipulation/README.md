		BRIEFLY EXPLANNATION ON BIT MANIPULATION IN C PROGRAMMING

Bit manipulation is the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits to achieve a required result. It is an act of algorithmically  manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word.

		COMPUTER PROGRAMMING TASKS THAT REQUIRE BIT MANIPULATION INCLUDES:

1).	Low-level device control
2).	Error detection and correction algorithms
3).	Data compression
4).	Encryption algorithms
5).	Optimization

		BIT MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES ALSO INCLUDES:
	
1).	Binary representation of a given number.
2).	Count set bits in an integer.
3).	Add two bit strings.
4).	Turn off the rightmost set bit.
5).	Rotate bits of a number.
6).	Compute modulus division by a power-of-2-number.
7).	Find the Number Occurring Odd Number of Times.
8).	Program to find whether a given number is power of 2.
